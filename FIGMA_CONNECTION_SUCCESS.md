## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Share Your WeAreOut Figma File

Just paste the Figma file URL (looks like):
```
https://www.figma.com/file/XXXXXXXXXXX/WeAreOut-Mobile-App
```

Or share the file key (the X's part above).

### 2. I'll Automatically:

✅ Fetch all screens and components
✅ Extract design system (colors, fonts, spacing)
✅ Map Figma frames to React Native screens
✅ Generate pixel-perfect code from your designs
✅ Keep design and code in sync

---

## 💡 Example Commands You Can Use

### View Your Designs
```
"Show me all frames in my WeAreOut Figma file"
"List all components in the design system"
```

### Extract Design System
```
"Extract the color palette from Figma"
"Get all typography styles from Figma"
"Generate design tokens from the Figma file"
```

### Generate Code
```
"Create the Dashboard screen from Figma"
"Build the Login screen exactly as designed in Figma"
"Generate all Button variants from the Figma component"
```

### Update Code
```
"Update the mobile app colors to match Figma"
"Sync all components with the latest Figma designs"
"Regenerate the theme files from Figma styles"
```

### Then We Can
3. Extract the complete design system (colors, fonts, spacing)
4. Generate all screen components from Figma frames
5. Build the component library matching Figma components
6. Set up automatic sync when designs change
